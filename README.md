# MyTradeLedger

MyTradeLedger is a simple, local-first crypto trade logging application. It allows you to record buy and sell trades, view them chronologically, and see cumulative profit or loss over time without unnecessary complexity.

The project is designed for traders who want a clear record of what trades were made and how their account is performing, while keeping full control over their data.

## Philosophy

MyTradeLedger focuses on clarity and accuracy rather than analysis or interpretation.

The goal is to answer a simple question:

> *What trades have I made, and am I making or losing money?*

There are no dashboards, scores, or performance labels. Just a clear, chronological record of trades and their financial results.
